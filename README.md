## General Information
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. We are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
 

## Business Goals

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house.

How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.


## Conclusions
Top 10 significant features are:
1. SaleCondition_Partial
2. SaleCondition_Others
3. SaleCondition_Normal
4. GarageFinish_Unf
5. GarageFinish_RFn
6. GarageFinish_No Garage
7. GarageType_Others
8. GarageType_No Garage
9. GarageType_Detchd
10. GarageType_BuiltIn
